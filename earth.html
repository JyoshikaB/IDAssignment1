             Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life. 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates[list] that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.

          <h3>Fact one</h3>
          <p>Earth one had two moons.(theory), put forward by a computer model that attempted to figure why the side of the moon that faces Earth is relatively low and flat and the one that faces away has a much thicker crust. The model suggests that there was once a "companion moon" that collided with the far side of our current moon</p>

          <h3>Fact three</h3>
          <p>Earth Is Not a Perfect Sphere.The Earth is obviously not flat, but it's not exactly round, either. It's more of a squashed sphere, because when it spins, gravity pushes in and centrifugal force pushes out. It creates what Scientific American calls "a sphere that is squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator."</p>

            Earth Used to Be Purple.At least, that's one scientific theory based on the idea that ancient microbes may have relied on a molecule called retinal, rather than chlorophyll, to absorb the sun's rays. Retinal (which can be found in organisms such as halobacteria) absorbs green light and reflects back red and violent light, creating a purple color. "Cosmic dust" sounds magical, but chances are you've inhaled a good amount of it just on your way to work. On a daily basis, dust from meteorites, comets, and other solar bodies fall to earth in tiny particles that increase the levels of sodium and iron in the planet's atmosphere. Scientists studying the phenomenon estimate that altogether, about 60 tons of cosmic dust is falling to earth daily.
