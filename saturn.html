            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century.

          <p>Saturn could float in water because it is mostly made of gas. Saturn has the lowest density of all the planets in our Solar System. 687 kg/m³.</p>

          A UI research team was able to directly sample Saturn’s E-ring. Though the largest of the planet’s rings, it’s mostly invisible. Intriguingly, it’s fed by geysers on one of one of Saturn’s moons, Enceladus. While the E-ring was known before Cassini arrived, the UI instrument helped map the density of dust in the ring, as well as the size of the dust grains.

          In some ways, Saturn’s ring system resembles the dust-and-gas ring that surrounds a young star. Planets may from such a ring, so understanding the size of dust grains and their distribution around Saturn may help scientists understand how planets form and evolve.
