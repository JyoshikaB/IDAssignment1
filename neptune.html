            <p>
              Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.

          <h3>Fact one</h3>
          <p>Neptune has the Strongest Winds in the Solar System:
          winds that go up to 2,100 km/hour.  One idea is that the cold temperatures and the flow of fluid gasses in the planet’s atmosphere might reduce friction to the point that it’s easy to generate winds that move so quickly.</p>

          <p>Neptune has Rings. Neptune has five          rings.These rings are composed of at least    20% dust (with some containing as much as 70%) which are micrometer-sized, similar to the particles that make up the rings of Jupiter. </p>

          <p>Neptune Probably Captured its Largest Moon, Triton.At some point, billions of years from now, Triton will likely will be torn apart by Neptune’s gravitational forces and become a magnificent ring around the planet.</p>

          Neptune has Only Been Visited up Close Once:
          The only spacecraft that has ever visited Neptune was NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft, which visited the planet during its Grand Tour of the Solar System. Voyager 2 made its Neptune flyby on August 25, 1989, passing within 3,000 km of the planet’s north pole. This was the closest approach to any object that Voyager 2 made since it was launched from Earth.
