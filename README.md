The reason why I wanted to create the website is to educate as many people as possible about our own solar system. Since Schools do not teach astronomy. I was passionate about astronomy and regret that I did not learn about it sooner, Therefore, it was my inspirational to create this website so that anyone can be passionate about it someday.
My design behind the website is to make it simple but attractive. I want the information to be clearly stored out so that is more readable. Therefore, adding many containers and animation. Since space colors are dark colors such as black, blue, purple. I decided to incorporate those colors into my website. Wireframe are added into the code. You can find my wireframe in wireframe.pdf.
